<br>

I am a Back‑end Developer and Data Analyst in training, passionate about building robust systems and extracting value from data. I am a Systems Analysis student and have completed freelance projects that allowed me to apply back-end technologies, databases, and data processing in real-world environments. I am currently continuing my self-directed training and showcasing my work in this repository and on my personal website [link](www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-lopez11). I am available for internships or new job opportunities; my resume is attached.
